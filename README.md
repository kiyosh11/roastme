roast people using their own cursed tweets, github, questions. no chill. no mercy. just pure digital violence.

## what is this

a next.js webapp that scrapes a user's recent x (formerly twitter) posts via [twstalker.com](https://twstalker.com) and feeds them to a hostile AI (powered by [groq](https://groq.com)) trained in psychological warfare. the result? an ego-shattering roast based entirely on their own public oversharing.

## features

- frontend form to humiliate your friends in style
- scrapes posts anonymously (rotating IPs + user agents)
- uses LLM to generate deeply personal roasts
- cache + rate limiting so it doesn't burst into flames
- max disrespect, min effort

## live site

[roaster2000.vercel.app](https://roaster2000.vercel.app)

## usage

enter any @handle into the site. wait. cry.

## how it works

1. user enters a username  
2. backend scrapes up to 10 public posts via twstalker  
3. raw content is sent to an LLM with a very unfriendly prompt  
4. user receives a violent roast  
5. repeat until humbled

## setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiyosh11/roastme
cd roastme
npm install
```
create a .env:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```
then run locally:
```
npm run dev
```
